\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chapter:intro}


Introduction tells the motivation, scope, goal and the outcome of the
work. Anyone should be able to understand it. The preferred order of
writing your master's thesis is about the same as the outline of the
thesis: you first discover your problem and write about that, then you
find out what methods you should use and write about that.  Then you
do your implementation, and document that, and so on.  However, the
abstract and introduction are often easiest to write last.  This is
because these really cover the entire thesis, and there is no way you
could know what to put in your abstract before you have actually done
your implementation and evaluation. This means that you have to
rewrite them in the end of your work.

By the way, rarely anyone write the thesis from the beginning to the
end just one time, but the writing is more like process, where every
piece of text is written at least twice. Be also prepared to delete
your own text. In the first phase, you can hide it into comments that
are started with \% but during the writing, the many comments should
be visible for your helpers, the advisor(s) and supervisor.

Read the information from the university master's thesis
pages  before starting the thesis.  You
should also go through the thesis grading
instruction  together with your advisor and/or
supervisor in the beginning of your work.

This is my master's thesis, and I am very proud of it.  Of course,
when I write my \emph{real} master's thesis, I will not use the
singular pronoun \emph{I}, but rather try to avoid referring to myself
and speak of the research \emph{we} have conducted---I rarely work
alone, after all.  Yet, both \emph{I} and \emph{we} are correct, and
it depends on the advisor and the supervisor (of course from you,
too), which one they would prefer. Anyway, the tense should be active,
and passive sentenses should be avoided (especially, writing sentences
where the subject is presented with by preposition), so often you
cannot avoid choosing between the pronouns. Life is strange, but there
you have it.

The introduction in itself is rarely very long; two to five pages
often suffice. It usually has two subsections with titles Problem
statement and Structure of the Thesis, as follows next.


\section{Problem statement}

Undergraduate students studying technical subjects do not consider
typography very interesting these days, and therefore the
typographical quality of many theses is unacceptably low.  We plan to
rectify this situation somewhat by providing a decent-quality example
thesis outline for students.  We expect that the typographical quality
of the master's theses will dramatically increase as the new thesis
outline is taken into use.


\section{Structure of the Thesis}
\label{section:structure} 

You should use transition in your text, meaning that you should help
the reader follow the thesis outline. Here, you tell what will be in
each chapter of your thesis. Often the thesis does not have as many
chapters as is in this template. For example, environment and
implementation can be combined as well as chapters of evaluation and
discussion.  The rest of this thesis is organized as
follows. Chapter~\ref{chapter:background} gives the background, etc.
