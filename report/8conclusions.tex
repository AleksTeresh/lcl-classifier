\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{chapter:conclusions}

Time to wrap it up!  Write down the most important findings from your
work.  Like the introduction, this chapter is not very long.  One to
two (never over three) pages might be a good limit. Still, the chapter
gives the background, goals, content, and the findings. However, all that
should already be in the previous chapters. This is just a summary (as
are the abstract and the introduction).

For making PDF/A version requested by the Aalto Library, open the end result pdf file in Acrobat and store it as PDF/A. Then verify the result (everything should be fine, at least as PDF/A-2b version works).

Congratulations, your thesis is ready and it looks beautiful!
