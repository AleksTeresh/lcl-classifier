\chapter{Meta-algorithms used in the solution}
\label{chapter:environment}

This chapter will describe in detail all the meta-algorithms that are
used in the final solution as subroutines.
Chapter 5 will then
describe how the final solution was built on top of the meta-algorithms
described in this chapter.

\section{Round Elimination}

This section explains in detail Round Elimination
technique introduced in Chapter 2, as well as
implementation of Round Elimination as a computer
program written in Rust \cite{Brandt2019, Olivetti2020}.
Besides, we will explain the relevance of the technique
and the software implementation for our problem. In order
to demonstrate the technique, we will have as our running
examples two canonical problems: weak 3-labelling and sinkless orientation.

\textbf{Weak 3-labeling} in this context is a problem on (3, 2)-biregular
trees.

\textbf{Sinkless orientation} is a problem on
